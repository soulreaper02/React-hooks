### What are Hooks ?

> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
> Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. 
> To read more about hooks visit [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html).

### Installation

$ npm start
```
